# Lab Devices

[![Deploy Jekyll site to Pages](https://github.com/antoniovazquezblanco/labdevices/actions/workflows/pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/antoniovazquezblanco/labdevices/actions/workflows/pages.yml)

This is the source for a one stop site for device manuals, repair guides, modifications and hacks for old laboratory devices. The idea is to keep old affordable devices running and as much up to date as possible!
