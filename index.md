This is a one stop site for manuals, repair guides, modifications and more for your laboratory equipment.

The goals of this site is to keep alive some of the old equipment that no longer suits modern labs but that can still be used for amateur projects. In the end, there is a ton of life in many of this devices and overall it is easier and cheaper to reuse than to recycle.
